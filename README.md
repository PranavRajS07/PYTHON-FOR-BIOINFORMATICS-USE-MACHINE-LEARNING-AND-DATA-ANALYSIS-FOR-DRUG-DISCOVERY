# Drug-Discovery
In this project, we use python and machine 
learning to build a bioinformatics project for drug 
discovery. Here we are collecting datasets, 
preprocessing the datasets, and performing 
exploratory data analysis. We have built machine 
learning models in order to make predictions and 
obtain data-driven insights that will be useful for 
drug discovery. Finally, we compare the models 
and select the right one for the use case.
